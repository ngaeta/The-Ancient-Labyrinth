1) Turn off the torch to be less visible to the monster. 
2) Don't always run, the player will get tired. You often take a breath.
3) Do not make too much noise when the monster is near
4) There are areas where the monster can not reach, use them to your advantage
5) When the monster sees you, try to run to a safe place or to sow it by exploiting the intersections of the labyrinth. 
The monster will lose your tracks. Do not try to run away, use your head.
