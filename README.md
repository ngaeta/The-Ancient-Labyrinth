# TheAncientLabyrintBetaUnity

 A horror videogame developed with Unity.
 Initially I was going to release it on steam, but due to the licensing of the 3D models and due to lack of time, I did not complete it.
 The videogame is playable from start to end, but has bugs and drops in frame rates in some areas.
 
 
The aim of the game is to find 8 gems solving puzzles while a monster seeks the protagonist in this ancient labyrinth. The game has a bit of lore that the most attentive player can seize, especially if he manages to open the door with the 8 gems. The monster sees and hears the player. The monster's AI was created by way of trigger, raycast and pathfinding. The player can use the maze crosses to make his monster lose track.
