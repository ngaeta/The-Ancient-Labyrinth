About project
============
My first real Unity project. I started developing it in 2017, before starting to study videogame programming at AIV(Italian videogame academy).
I didn't know Unity very well so I think the code isn't very well written, but it all works pretty well to the point that could release it 
on steam if I could solve the problems related above all to the licenses of the models.
 
 About game
 ===========
The aim of the game is to find 8 gems solving puzzles while a monster seeks the protagonist in this ancient labyrinth. The game has a bit 
of lore that the most attentive player can seize, especially if he manages to open the door with the 8 gems. The monster sees and hears the 
player. The monster's AI was created by way of trigger, raycast and pathfinding. The player can use the maze crosses to make his monster 
lose track.
