# TheAncientLabyrintBetaUnity
 A horror videogame developed with Unity.
 Initially I was going to release it on steam, but due to the licensing of the 3D models and due to lack of time, I did not complete it.
 The videogame is playable from start to end, but has bugs and drops in frame rates in some areas.
